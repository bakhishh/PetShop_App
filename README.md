# PetShop_App
The PetShop Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application integrated with a PostgreSQL database, designed to streamline the operations of a pet store. This system provides a user-friendly interface for managing pet-related activities, including advertising pets for adoption, selling pets, and facilitating the purchase of pets.

PetSet - Pet Adoption System

Users can register and log in to the system with a username and password. Upon logging in, they can choose the type of pet they are interested in (cat, dog, bird, etc.), and adoption announcements for that specific type of animal will be displayed. Users can apply for adoption by submitting an application for a particular announcement. The system should list the names of individuals and their respective cities who have applied for each adoption announcement.

After applying, users' names, along with the city they reside in, should be visible among the applicants. Users should be able to view the adoption announcements they have applied for on their personal page. Additionally, they should be able to enter and update personal information, including their address.

As an additional feature, users can also create adoption announcements for their own pets. The system should support the purchase of various pet products through a shopping module.
